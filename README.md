# Biogas prediction
Biogas prediction with deep learning
## Problem description
The goal is to model the anaerobic digestion process for biogas production
## Data
At the moment all data are generated from ADM1 model

The features are the Vs of cow, pig, poultry and the measurements are methname production (CH4) and amonia (NH4)

## NARX model
For modeling we use the **Non linear AutoRegressive with eXogenous** inputs neural network model 
using matlab deep learning toolbox. For more info about NARX see matlab docs
## Data extract
